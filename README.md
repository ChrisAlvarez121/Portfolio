# Portfolio
The programs in this portfolio will showcase the particular skills I had learned through creating various school projects.
When I created these programs I was intially not required to unit test my methods. However, I will update all of my programs with proper unit tests in the near future.

Assignment #4: Is a wastemanagment program that calculates the price of recycleable bottles and cans based on their material, type, and weight. The program then creates a .csv file showcasing the users recycleable materials and how much money they would recieve if they turned them in. The program makes use of Recursion, Exception handling, ArrayLists, and PolyMorphism.
